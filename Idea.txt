Application Overview
The Campus Trading Application is a trusted marketplace designed exclusively for university students to buy and sell items within their campus community. Unlike generic platforms or chaotic WhatsApp groups, this system creates a safe, organized environment where students can trade textbooks, electronics, furniture, and other items with verified peers.
The application addresses real pain points students face: discovering who's selling what, verifying seller authenticity, comparing prices for similar items, finding specific items they need, and building trust through transparent transaction histories. By restricting access to verified students with university email addresses, the platform creates a closed, accountable community where reputation matters.
At its core, the system operates on three pillars: a marketplace where sellers list items with detailed information and photos, a wish board where buyers can post requests for items they're looking for, and a trust framework that encourages reliable behavior through ratings, verification badges, and transaction history.
2. User Roles and Their Interactions
Students (Primary Users)
Students wear multiple hats in this ecosystem. As sellers, they list items they no longer need, respond to buyer inquiries, manage price negotiations, and arrange meetups. As buyers, they browse listings, search for specific items, submit price offers on negotiable items, and complete purchases. The same student might sell their old chemistry textbook while simultaneously searching for a used bicycle.
Every student has a profile that serves as their trading identity. This profile displays their name, department, year of study, verification status, hostel, room number, mobile number, number of successful transactions, average rating, and items they're currently selling or have sold. This transparency builds trust—students can see they're dealing with a real peer who has a track record.
Campus Administrators (Conceptual)
Administrators maintain the health of the marketplace. They verify student accounts by confirming university email addresses, monitor listings for prohibited items or inappropriate content, resolve disputes between buyers and sellers, generate reports on trading patterns, and manage the platform's category structure. They act as moderators ensuring the community remains safe and functional.


3. Core Features and Functionalities
Trust and Verification System
When students register, they must verify their identity using their university email address. Once verified, they receive a "Verified Student" badge visible on their profile. After each transaction, both parties can rate each other and leave brief reviews. These ratings are publicly visible, creating accountability.
To prevent fake accounts, the system limits actions for brand new users—perhaps they can only list one or two items initially, with restrictions lifting after their first successful transaction. This prevents spam without being overly restrictive.
4. Detailed Workflows
Listing an Item for Sale
When Sarah wants to sell her engineering textbook, she clicks "Create Listing" and fills out a form. She enters the item name, selects a category (in this case, "Books & Textbooks"), specifies the subject or course code, sets her asking price, writes a description explaining the book's condition, and uploads several photos showing the cover, any highlighting or damage.
She indicates her preferred meeting locations—perhaps the engineering building lobby or the campus library. Importantly, she can mark the listing as "Negotiable" if she's willing to consider different price offers. If she marks it as negotiable, buyers will be able to submit their own price offers rather than just accepting her listed price.
Once published, the listing becomes immediately searchable. Sarah can view notifications when someone views her listing, adds it to their watchlist, or submits a price offer. She can edit the listing anytime, review incoming offers, or mark it "Sold" when the transaction completes.
Searching and Browsing
Mike is looking for a desk lamp for his dorm room. He opens the app and sees several pathways: he can browse by category (Home & Furniture → Lighting), use the search bar to type "desk lamp," or filter by price range, condition (new, like new, good, fair), and distance (items listed by students in his residence hall appear first).
Search results display as cards showing the item photo, title, price (or "Negotiable" if the seller accepts offers), seller's name and rating, and how long ago it was listed. Mike can sort results by price (low to high), newest listings first, or by seller rating. He spots a lamp that looks perfect, clicks to see the full listing with all photos and details, and notices the seller has a 4.8-star rating with 12 completed sales.
Submitting a Price Offer (Negotiation Workflow)
When Mike views a listing that is marked as "Negotiable," he sees the seller's asking price alongside a button that says "Make an Offer." Mike clicks this button and enters his proposed price—perhaps $15 instead of the seller's asking price of $20.
Mike can also include a brief message with his offer: "Would you accept $15? I can pick it up today." Once submitted, this offer becomes visible to the seller in their "Offers Received" section.
The system handles multiple competing offers elegantly: If several students are interested in the same item, each can submit their own price offer. The seller sees all incoming offers in a list, showing:
* Buyer's name and rating
* Offered price
* Any message from the buyer
* Time the offer was submitted
* Buyer's location (hostel/building) for convenience
The listing status automatically changes to "Pending" once the first offer is received, signaling to other interested buyers that the seller is reviewing offers. However, other buyers can still submit their own offers during this pending period—they aren't locked out.
Seller Managing Multiple Offers
Back to Sarah, who listed her textbook as negotiable. Over the course of a day, she receives three offers:
* Student A: Offered $35 (her asking price was $40), lives in the same hostel, 4.9-star rating
* Student B: Offered $30, lives across campus, 4.2-star rating
* Student C: Offered $38, lives nearby, new user with no rating yet
Sarah reviews all three offers in her "Manage Offers" dashboard. She can see each buyer's profile, rating, and location. She has several options:
1. Accept an offer: She selects Student C's offer and clicks "Accept." This immediately notifies Student C that their offer was accepted and moves the transaction to "Reserved" status.
2. Counter an offer: She might click "Counter Offer" on Student A's $35 offer and propose $37 instead, starting a back-and-forth negotiation.
3. Decline an offer: She can politely decline offers that don't meet her minimum acceptable price.
4. Wait for more offers: She can leave all offers pending while waiting to see if better offers come in.
When Sarah accepts an offer, the system automatically:
* Notifies the selected buyer that their offer was accepted
* Notifies other buyers that the item is no longer available
* Changes the listing status to "Reserved"
* Prompts both parties to arrange a meeting time and location
Completing a Transaction
After the buyer and seller meet offline and exchange cash for the item, both receive a notification prompting them to confirm the transaction completed successfully. This confirmation is crucial—it updates both students' transaction counts and prompts them to leave ratings.
The buyer rates the seller and writes a brief review: "Great condition, exactly as described, friendly and on time."
These ratings immediately update their public profiles. The listing automatically moves to the seller's "Sold Items" history and disappears from active listings. The transaction is now marked as "Completed" in the system.
When Negotiations Fall Through
Not all offers lead to successful transactions. If a seller accepts an offer but the buyer becomes unresponsive, the seller can mark the offer as "Cancelled" and either:
* Accept one of the other pending offers
* Re-list the item as available
Similarly, if a buyer submits an offer but changes their mind before the seller accepts, they can withdraw their offer. 
Posting a Wish Request
Instead of passively searching, students can post what they're looking for. Emma needs a graphing calculator for her statistics course but finds none listed. She creates a wish request specifying:
* Item Needed: TI-84 Plus calculator
* Budget Range: $40-60
* Needed By: Next week
* Additional Details: "Prefer one with fresh batteries and protective case"
Other students browsing the wish board see Emma's request. If someone has that calculator, they can click "I Have This" which creates a new listing automatically populated with Emma's request details. The system notifies Emma that someone has responded to her wish request, and she can view the listing and submit an offer if interested. They remain active until the student marks them as fulfilled or expired. 
Browsing Without Immediate Purchase Intent
Students can browse casually without committing to anything. They can add items to their watchlist to monitor them, view seller profiles to check ratings and transaction history, or simply explore what's available in different categories. The watchlist notifies students if:
* The price of a watched item is lowered
* A watched item receives many offers (suggesting it's popular and might sell soon)
* A watched item is about to expire or be removed
5. Additional Features for Campus Relevance
Donation Option
Not everything needs to be sold. Students leaving campus might want to give away items they can't transport. A "Free - Just Take It" category or donation listings make this easy. Students can list items as free, and interested students claim them first-come, first-served.
For free items, the workflow is simpler: interested students click "I Want This," the original poster sees who's interested and can choose someone based on their profile (perhaps prioritizing students with good ratings or those who can pick up quickly), and they arrange a meetup.
Condition Standards
To reduce disputes, the platform defines condition ratings with examples:
* New: Unopened, with tags or original packaging
* Like New: Barely used, no visible wear
* Good: Used with minor cosmetic imperfections, fully functional
* Fair: Noticeable wear but still usable
* Poor: Significant damage, may need repairs
When sellers select a condition, they see these definitions, creating consistency across listings. Buyers know exactly what to expect based on the condition tag.
Report and Flagging System
If students encounter suspicious listings, inappropriate behavior, or scams, they can easily report them. Reports go to administrators with context about what's concerning. Repeated reports on a user trigger reviews. The system might temporarily hide listings pending review rather than immediately removing them, protecting against false reports.
Students can report:
* Misleading item descriptions
* Inappropriate photos or content
* Suspected scams
* Price manipulation or fake offers
6. Transaction Flow States
Throughout a transaction, the system tracks states visible to both parties:
Listed
Item is actively available. Buyers can view it, add it to watchlists, and if marked as negotiable, submit price offers. If the listing has a fixed price (not negotiable), buyers can contact the seller to express interest.
Pending
At least one buyer has submitted a price offer and the seller is reviewing offers. The listing shows "Pending" to other users, but they can still submit additional offers. This creates a competitive environment where sellers can choose the best offer from multiple interested buyers.
During pending status, the seller sees all submitted offers and can:
* Accept one offer (moves to Reserved)
* Counter any offer (stays Pending while negotiating)
* Decline offers (stays Pending if other offers remain)
* Wait for additional offers
Reserved
Seller has accepted a specific buyer's offer. Both parties can see:
* Agreed price
* Meeting details (time and location to be coordinated)
* Each other's contact information
Other users see the listing as "Reserved" and cannot submit new offers. If the reserved transaction falls through (buyer doesn't show up or cancels), the seller can move the listing back to Pending or Listed.
Completed
Both parties have met, exchanged the item for payment, and confirmed the transaction in the app. The system now prompts both to leave ratings and reviews. The listing is no longer visible to other users in active searches.
Sold
Transaction fully concluded with ratings exchanged. The listing moves to the seller's "Transaction History" as a completed sale and to the buyer's history as a completed purchase. This data contributes to both users' ratings and transaction counts.
Expired
Listing has been active for an extended period (perhaps 30 days) without any offers or activity. The system automatically archives it, but the seller can re-list the item if they still want to sell it.
Withdrawn
Seller decided not to sell the item anymore. This might happen if they changed their mind, the item was damaged, or they sold it through another channel. Any pending offers are automatically declined with a notification to buyers.
7. Price Negotiation System - Detailed Flow
How Offers Work
The offer system is central to the platform's functionality. Here's how it works in detail:
Seller's Perspective:
1. When creating a listing, the seller sets an asking price and checks "Allow Offers" if they're willing to negotiate
2. As offers come in, they appear in the seller's "Offers Dashboard" with full details about each buyer
3. The seller can sort offers by price (highest first), buyer rating (most trusted first), or time submitted (first-come basis)
4. The seller can accept, decline, or counter each offer independently
5. Once an offer is accepted, all other offers are automatically declined.
Buyer's Perspective:
1. When viewing a negotiable listing, the buyer sees the asking price and an "Make Offer" button
2. Clicking this opens a form where they enter their proposed price and optional message
3. After submitting, they can view the status of their offer: "Submitted," "Seller Reviewing," "Accepted," "Declined," or "Item Sold to Another Buyer"
4. If their offer is accepted, they receive immediate notification and can proceed to arrange the meetup
5. If declined, they can either submit a higher offer or move on to other listings


Counter-Offers: Either party can initiate counter-offers:
* If a seller receives a $30 offer on a $40 item, they can counter with $35
* The buyer is notified of the counter-offer and can accept, decline, or counter again
* This creates a negotiation thread visible to both parties until they reach agreement or someone walks away
Offer Expiration
To prevent stale offers from cluttering the system:
* Offers automatically expire after 48 hours if the seller doesn't respond
* Buyers can manually withdraw their offers anytime before acceptance
* Accepted offers are valid for 7 days,if the meetup doesn't happen within a week, the reservation expires and the item can be re-listed
8. User Profile and Reputation System
Profile Information Display
Every student profile shows:
* Basic Info: Name, department, year of study, hostel, room number
* Contact: Mobile number (visible only after an offer is accepted)
* Verification: Verified student badge, profile photo
* Stats: Total transactions completed, average rating (out of 5 stars)
* Bio: Brief introduction [optional]
* Activity: Currently selling items, recently sold items, current wish requests [optional]
Rating and Review System
After each completed transaction, the buyer rates the seller on a 5-star scale and can leave a text review (optional). The system calculates:
* Overall Rating: Average of all ratings received
* Rating Distribution: How many 5-star, 4-star, etc. reviews
* Recent Reviews: Latest 5 reviews displayed on profile
Reviews are public and permanent, creating accountability. Students can respond to reviews left about them, adding their perspective if needed.
9. Search and Discovery Features [conceptual]
Search Capabilities
Students can find items through multiple methods:
Category Browsing: Navigate through hierarchical categories:
* Books & Textbooks → Engineering → Mechanical Engineering
* Electronics → Computing → Laptops, calculators,
* Furniture → Study Furniture → Desks
* Sports & Fitness → Gym Equipment → Dumbbells
Keyword Search: Type any term and the system searches across:
* Item titles
* Descriptions
* Course codes (for textbooks)
* Categories
Filters: Narrow results by:
* Price range (min and max)
* Condition (new, like new, good, fair, poor)
* Location (same hostel, nearby hostels, anywhere on campus)
* Negotiability (show only negotiable items, show only fixed-price items)
* Availability (only show "Listed" items, include "Pending" items)
* Seller rating (minimum rating threshold)
Sorting Options:
* Price: Low to High or High to Low
* Date: Newest First or Oldest First
* Seller Rating: Highest Rated First
* Distance: Closest First
Wish Board
The wish board is a separate section where students post requests for items they're seeking. It functions as a reverse marketplace:
Creating a Wish Request:
* Item description
* Budget range (minimum and maximum willing to pay)
* Preferred condition
* Additional requirements or preferences
Browsing Wish Requests: Sellers can browse the wish board to see what students are actively looking for. This helps them:
* Decide what items from their possessions might have buyers
* Price items competitively based on stated budgets
* Identify trends (lots of requests for textbooks before semester starts)
Responding to Wishes: When a seller has an item someone wished for, they click "I Have This" and the system:
* Creates a new listing automatically filled with relevant details from the wish request
* Notifies the wisher that their request has a match
* Links the listing to the wish request so the wisher can easily find it
10. Notification System
Students receive notifications for important events:
